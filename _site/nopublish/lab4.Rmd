 knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE,

# Create a RStudio Project on your machine

* Name the Project "lab_4"
* Within the Project create a folder for *data* and *scripts*.
* Download the following three datasets into the project *data* folder.
  + *sesame13.sav*
  + *star.csv*
  + *ais.xlsx*
* Save a lab_4 .Rmd file in your *scripts* folder

# Part 1

Install and load the package `{Lahman}`, which will give you access to the *Teams* data.

```{r teams_echo}
#install.packages("Lahman")
library(rio)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
library(janitor)
```

#### 1. Produce a subset of the data (as a new object) that has the following characteristics:
*  only one team (your choice)
  + (try to you select a team that is currently still around, or it probably won't be interesting; see a list of current at [http://www.espn.com/mlb/teams](http://www.espn.com/mlb/teams)).
* data from 1980 to present (or as current as the dataset allows)
* includes 5 columns: `name`, `yearID`, `W`, `L`, `R`, `RA`. These 5 variables correspond to the team name, the year, wins, losses, runs scored, and runs allowed).

```{r p1-1}
teams <- Teams %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```


#### 2. Create a new variable corresponding to the winning percentage for the team you chose over time:

$$w_{pct} = \frac{wins}{wins + losses}$$
* Order by winning percentage: Least to greatest
* Order by winning percentage: Greatest to least
* Compute the `mean` and `standard deviation` of winning percentage

```{r p1-2}
# Order by winning percentage: Least to greatest


# Order by winning percentage: greatest to least


# Compute the mean and standard deviation of winning percentage


```

#### 3. With the full *Teams* data:
* Compute the `mean` and `standard deviation` of winning percentage for each team and then
* Order by winning percentage, greatest to least

```{r}

```

#### 4. Use the full data to reproduce the plot below

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
# Please put the code for the plot in this chunk.
teams %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(w_pct = w / (w + l)) %>% 
  filter(name == "New York Yankees" |
         name == "Detroit Tigers" |
         name == "San Diego Padres") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_id, w_pct)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = name)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    color = "Team"
  )

```

# Part 2

#### 1. Read in the following three datasets, using `{here}` and the package of your choice (`{rio}`, `{readr}`, `{haven}`, `{readxl}`)
* *sesame13.sav*
* *star.csv*
* *ais.xlsx*
  
**Hint**: For the *ais.xlsx* data, look at the `skip` argument within the [`{readxl}`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html) help documentation.
  
```{r import}



```

#### 2. Using the *ais* data, compute the average red blood cell count and average `bmi` by sport. Output these data as SPSS and EXCEL files. 

```{r q2}


```

#### 3. Use the *sesame* data to answer the following question: Was the average female age higher in schools or at home? 

```{r q3}



```

#### 4. First, how many rows and columns are in the *star* data? Next, remove outliers using a really poor method, just for practice, by eliminating students whose math (`tmathss`) scores were more than three standard deviations *above __or__ below* the corresponding mean. How many rows are in the data now?

```{r q4}


  
```

#### 5. Use the *star* data to compute standardized math and reading scores; name these variables *tmathss* and *treadss*. To create standardized scores, for each variable (math and reading), subtract the mean from each observation and divide by the standard deviation: $x_s = \frac{x_i - \bar{X}}{sd(X)}$. 
* Check that your computations were correct by computing the mean and standard deviation of each variable (they should be 0 and 1, respectively). 
* Compute the mean of the standardized variable for all `sex`/`frl` combinations. (I'm asking you to extend what you know here. We haven't talked explicitly about how to do this yet, but you have seen examples). 
* What do you make of these findings? Do you see an effect by `sex`? An `frl` effect (`frl` stands for free/reduced lunch, and is a rough proxy for household income)? Is there evidence of an interaction (i.e., that the effect of `frl` is greater for boys versus girls)?

```{r q5}
