# Grading

```{r, echo=FALSE}

read_csv(here("rubrics", "grades_rubric.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ifelse(is.na(.), "", .))) %>% 
  kable(caption = "<b>Grading Components</b>") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 14, position = "left")

```

---

# Homeworks

* Scored on a “best honest effort” basis
  + generally zero or full credit 
* If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, **please contact the instructors for help rather than submitting incomplete work**
  + Contacting the instructor is part of the “best honest effort” and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the work is not fully complete
* **If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help, it is likely to result is a partial credit score or a zero** * Labs submitted late will be docked by 30% (3 points)
  + Labs are generally due the class after they are assigned, before class starts

---

# Final Project

* Group project, 3-4 people
* Rmarkdown document

**Final project must:**
* Be fully reproducible
  + This implies the data are open
* Be a collaborative project hosted on GitHub
* Move data from its raw "messy" format to a tidy data format
* Include at least two exploratory plots
* Include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models are also encouraged

---

# Welcome to `R`

---

# What is `R`

* `R` is an environment and programming language, created primarily for statistical analyses and graphics
* No point-and-click interface
* Open source
  + source code is freely available, and can be redistributed and modified
* Incredibly powerful and flexible
  + Vast array of external packages available for specilized functions (analyses, data visualizations, automate the data “cleaning" process)

> The bad news is that whenever you learn a new skill you're going to suck. It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing nothing to becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and great suckiness.

# Moving to code/programming

.pull-left[
**Advantages**
* Flexibility
  + Essentially anything is possible
* Transparency
  + Documented history of your analysis
* Efficiency
  + Many tasks can be automated
]

--

.pull-right[
**Disadvantages**
* Steep learning curve
  + Definitely requires a significant time investment
  + Similar to learning a new language
* You will lose patience with point-and-click interfaces
* Likely to become "one of the converted"

# Code-based Interface

## `R`

### This is the `R` console

![](../images/console.png)

---

# Code-based Interface

## RStudio

### This is the RStudio IDE _(Integrated Development Environment)_

![](./images/ide.png)

---

# How to learn `R`?

* Time
* Use it!
* Dedication and determination help
* Be patient and forgiving with yourself, it will feel slow at first
* I still get frustrated

---

# `R` as a big calculator

```{r}
3 + 2
```

```{r}
3 / (3+2)
```

---

# Object Assignment `<-`

Objects are stored in active memory of your computer with names that you provide

`<-` is the assignment operator

It is used to assign names to objects (like an `=` operator)

--

```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 2
a
```

--

```{r}
a + b
```

--

```{r}
a / (a + b)
```

---

# Re-assignment

```{r}
a <- 10
a
```

--

```{r}
a <- "EDLD 651"
a
```

---

# Data Types

Objects can be a variety of types

--

* character: `"Hello world!"` or `"EDLD 651"`

--

* numeric: `2` and/or `15.5`
  + decimal also called `double`

--

* integer: `2L` (the `L` tells `R` to store this as an integer)

--

* logical: `TRUE` or `FALSE`

--

These objects can be extremely useful in programming

---

# Objects

Objects can also be:
* variables, data sets, models, results, functions, figures, more…

You can then use or manipulate these in different ways
* e.g., plots, functions, operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison)

---

# `R` Functions

Anything that carries out an operation in R is a function, even `+`

Functions are generally followed by `()`
* `**package::function()**`
  + `sum()`
  + `lm()`
  + `sqrt()`

---

# Getting help

`?` before a function name can be very helpful (and also confusing early on)

* Helpful for understanding formal *arguments* of a function
  + *arguments* are options within a `function()`

`?function_name()`  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?mutate() #(mutate() is a function in the dplyr package)

?dplyr::mutate()
```

# `R` Packages

---

# The data science pipeline

![](./images/ds_pipeline.png)

.footnote[
[R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html)
]

--

### How do we go about this?

---

# "Out of the box" functionality

`R` Packages provide functions (and datasets) for you to use

Some packages are pre-loaded
* `{base}`
* `{graphics}`
* `{stats}`

Some packages are pre-installed
* `{boot}`
* `{MASS}`
* `{Matrix}`

---

# Pre-loaded vs Installed

Pre-loaded packages work on launch

For example, `plot()` is part of the `{graphics}` package, which ships with `R`
--

```{r, fig.height=5}
plot(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
```

---

# `{base}` package

* All functions come from a package

--

* What do you get with the following?

`?'+'`

---

background-image: url("./images/plus_help.png")

---

# Packages on CRAN

There is a TON of functionality that comes with R right from your initial download **BUT** the functionality can be extended by installing other packages

--

CRAN is the official repository
* a network of servers maintained by the R community around the world
* coordinated by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/)
* a package needs to pass several tests to be published on CRAN

--

Most often, you will first install a package, then load it
* `install.packages(“package_name”)`
* `library(package_name)`

--

You will only need to install a package one time (generally). After that, it is in your library, and only needs to be loaded

--

Currently, the CRAN package repository features 18,000+ packages
* 16,300+ last year at this time
* constantly evolving to keep up with the varied demands of the data science community

---

# One more time

--

`install.packages(“package_name”)`

--

* you will only need to do this the FIRST time you use the package
* don’t keep this code line (you can run it in the console, or delete it from your script)
* notices the quotes

--

`library(package_name)`

--

* you will do this each time you use the package in your scripts
* notices no quotes

---

# Other packages

On GitHub

* Popular repository for open source projects
  + Integrated with git (version control)
  + Easy to share/collaborate
* Not necessarily `R` specific
* Generally, these packages “in development,” or are the beta versions of existing packages
* No review process associated with GitHub

---

# Possibilities

With just a basic knowledge of R you have access to thousands of packages 
* Expanding on a daily basis
* Provides access to cutting edge and specialized functionality for analysis, data visualization, and data preparation
* Some of the most modern thinking on data analysis topics are often represented in these packages

# Let's dive in

## (or end here for today)

---

# How do we access variables?

* Generally, in this course, with `{tidyverse}` tools
* Sometimes with `$` or with `[]`
  + `data_name$variable_name`
  + `data_name["variable_name"]`

--

Let's load the tidyverse, and then we'll access some variables from the datasets within some of those packages
* Look at the gss_cat data frame

```{r}
# if you have never installed the {tidyverse} package, you will need to do that first
#install.packages(“tidyverse”) 

library(tidyverse)

gss_cat
```

---

# Selecting varaibles

Select the `marital` variable with `$`

--

```{r}
gss_cat$marital
```

---

# Look at the `str`ucture of an object

```{r}
str(gss_cat$marital)
```

--

```{r}
str(gss_cat)
```

---

## Because `gss_cat` is a `tibble`

```{r}
gss_cat
```

---

# When to use `$`?

* Often when you need to use `{base} R` 
* Execute a funtion casually

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
table(gss_cat$marital)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
hist(gss_cat$age)
```
]

---

# Your turn

Run `table()` on the `religion` variable

Produce a `hist`ogram of the `tvhours` variable

---

# The pipe operator (`%>%`)

* The `%>%` operator (Super + Shift + M) inserts the input from the left as the first argument in the next function
* To start, you can read it as, “then”
* It is crucial for work in the `{tidyverse}`

--

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  count(marital)
```

--

We will talk about this a lot more later

---

# Why use `%>%`

Chaining arguments is **efficient** and **easy to read**

--

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  filter(relig == "Buddhism",
         age > 55) %>% 
  select(age, partyid, rincome) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

--

Equivalent to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
slice(arrange(select(filter(gss_cat, relig == "Buddhism", age > 55), age, partyid, rincome), age), 1:5)
```
