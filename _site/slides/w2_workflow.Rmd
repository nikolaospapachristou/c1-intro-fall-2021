# Workflow
## Week 2

---

# Agenda

* Project Oriented Workflow
  + RStudio Projects
  + File paths
  + Reading in data
  + Scripts (.R & .Rmd)
  + Loading packages
* Looking at data
* The pipe `%>%`

**Overall Purpose**

* Establish good workflow habits

---
class: inverse, left, middle

# RStudio Projects

---

# RStudio Projects (.RProj)

An RStudio project - .Rproj - is basically a folder to house all the files for your project
* scripts
* products
* data
* figures

--

**Advantages**

* Work with several projects at the same time (several projects open)
  + these are self-contained!

* Can save the history of your commands after quitting

* Can specify version control system (e.g., Git)

* Previously edited code tabs are restored upon opening

* The current working directory is set to the project directory

---

# What's a working directory?

Where you're at on your computer

You *can* change your working directory with `setwd("path/to/files")`...

...**BUT** I strongly urge you to avoid that

Instead, we‚Äôre going to use RStudio Projects and the `{here}` package

You can `list.files(`*path*`)` to see the contents of your pr0ject directory (i.e., what your computer "sees")

--

* See where you're currently at by looking at the top of the console
* Or run `getwd()` in the console
--

![](./images/directory.png)
---

# What's different with .Rproj?

Your working directory is immediately wherever your project is located

Use the `{here}` package to read/save data (and figures, products, etc.) which we'll talk about more later

---

.pull-left[
### `setwd()`

* `setwd()` ONLY works for you
* Can‚Äôt share it out without A LOT of code editing
* `setwd()` makes it difficult to work on other projects with different directories
  + You have to remember to change it
  + Or work leaks across projects (objects, data, packages)

Instead: **`here()`**
]

--

.pull-right[
### `rm(list = ls())`

* Does NOT create a fresh R process
* Only deletes user-created objects
* Packages are still loaded!
* Options that have been reset in code still exist
* Your script is not self-contained!
* Not friendly to your collaborators! (deletes their objects)

Instead: **Session > Restart R** (Ctrl/Command + Shift + F10)
]

---
background-size: contain

background-image: url("./images/hadley-tweet_1.png")

---

# Project Oriented Workflow

Solution: Write every script assuming it will be run in a fresh `R` process

* Do not save `.RData` when you quit `R` and don‚Äôt load `.RData` when you start `R`

* Daily work habit: 
  + Restart `R` very often and re-run your developing script from the top
  + Use the RStudio menu item: Session > Restart R (Ctrl/Command + Shift + F10)

---
class: inverse, left, middle

# Workflow

---

# Let‚Äôs start by making a new project

1. Make a new .RProj
2. Create folders
  + data
  + scripts
3. Read in data
4. Scripts
5. Load packages

---
class: inverse, left, middle

# RStudio Project

---

# 1. Make a new .RProj

Let‚Äôs name it: "my_first_project"
* notice the naming convention
  + no caps
  + no spaces
  + no special characters (e.g., ?, !, ", #)
  + "_" and "-" are ok
  
--
  
Choose a location for it
* An .RProj will need its own folder, with no other projects in it!
* Projects in Dropbox often lead to unexpected occurences

--

Let's just save "my_first_project" on our desktops

**.darkorange[demo]**

---
class: inverse, left, middle

# Organize

---

# 2. Create folders

Let‚Äôs make two folder in different ways (either is fine)

**data**
* where we will store all our project-related data
* let‚Äôs create that in Rstudio

**scripts**
* where we will hold all our scripts (.R or .Rmd files)
* let‚Äôs create that in the folder on our machine

**.darkorange[demo]**

---
class: inverse, left, middle

# Reading Data

---

Let‚Äôs save the following data files into our project "data" folder

1. ecls-k_samp.sav
2. Fatality.txt
3. Project_Reads_Scores.csv

---

# Reading data into `R` 

You need one thing:

1. **where** the data is located

--

This is often just a path on you machine

--

We'll be talking about two data reading packages

1. `{rio}`
2. `{readr}`

---

# Data Location

]

.right-column[
### We‚Äôll use the `{here}` package

`{here}` uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files

* Allows you to worry about paths a little less
* Helps reproducibility
* Your final project!

Think of `here()` simply as a function to print a path

# [`{here}`](https://here.r-lib.org/)

Think of `here()` simply as a function to print a path

Try the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the package (in the console)
# install.packages("here") 
#  Then, load the package
library(here)
```

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here()
```

--

This is the "top level" directory of our project

---

# [`{here}`](https://here.r-lib.org/)

Think of `here()` simply as a function to print a path

Try the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the package (in the console)
# install.packages("here") 
#  Then, load the package
library(here)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here("data")
```

--

This is the path to the "data" folder in our project directory

---

# [`{here}`](https://here.r-lib.org/)

Think of `here()` simply as a function to print a path

Try the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the package (in the console)
# install.packages("here") 
#  Then, load the package
library(here)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here("data")
```

**Question:** What was the difference between the last two functions?

--

**Question:** What will the following produce?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav")
```

---

### Let's see files are in our "data" folder

`list.files(here("data"))`

You can also use the *Files* tab in RStudio

--

Use `here()` to access data or any file in your project

--

`here()` is simply a function to print a path

--

**.darkorange[demo]**

---

# `{rio}`

* `{rio}` is a wrapper around different packages that import/export data in different formats
* Great package;  most of the time "it just works" regardless of the source file type
* This might not impress you, but it really should! 
* Any package that ‚Äújust works‚Äù and turns a complex task into a simple procedure is invaluable

---

# [`import()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html)

.darkorange[`import`]`(`.darkblue[`file`]`,` .pink[`format`]`,` .green[`setclass`], `...)`

.darkblue[`file`]       = character string naming a file

--

.pink[`format`]         = (optional) character string of file format; e.g., `","` for comma-separated values

.green[`setclass`]      = (optional) character vector specifying one or more classes to set on the import. Default is `"data.frame"`. We would probably prefer `"tbl_df"` for a `tibble`

---

# 3a. Read in data

Try it!

```{r}
library(rio)

eclsk <- import(here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav"), setclass = "tbl_df")

fatality <- import(here("data", "Fatality.txt")) %>% 
  as_tibble()

exam1 <- import(here("data", "Project_Reads_Scores.csv")) %>% 
  as_tibble()

```

---

### You can even read directly from the web üò≤

### change link

```{r}
import("https://github.com/datalorax/ncme_18/raw/master/data/pubschls.csv",
       setclass = "tbl_df")
```

---

# [`export()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html)

Save data just as easily with `export()`

.darkorange[`export`]`(`.gray[`x`]`,` .darkblue[`file`]`,` .pink[`format`]`, ...)`

.gray[`x`]      = data frame (tibble) to be written into a file

.darkblue[`file`] = character string naming a file

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
export(exam1, here("data", "exam1.sav"))

export(exam1, here("data", "exam1.txt"))

export(exam1, here("data", "exam1.dta"))
```

---

# `convert()`

Another really useful feature is `convert()`, which just takes a file of one type and converts it to another

Say your advisor uses SPSS, but their colleague uses Stata (and you use `R` üòé) 

Just run one line of code!

--

.darkorange[`convert`]`(`.lightblue[`in_file`]`,` .darkblue[`out_file`]`, ...)`

.lightblue[`in_file`] = character string naming an input file

.darkblue[`out_file`] = character string naming an output file

--

.darkorange[`convert`]`(here("data", `.lightblue[`ecls-k_samp.sav`])),<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;`(here("data", `.darkblue[`ecls-k_samp.dta`]))

---

# How is this all working?

`{rio}` wraps a variety of faster, more stream-lined packages than those provided by base `R` 
* `{data.table}` for delimited formats
* `{haven}` for SAS, Stata, and SPSS files
* `{readxl}` and `{openxlsx}` for reading and writing Excel workbooks
* `data.table::fread()` for text-delimited files to automatically determine the file format regardless of the extension
  + also crazy fast
--

* again, "just works"

---

# Maintaining labels

**Question: How many of you or your colleagues use SPSS or Stata?**

In SPSS, numeric data are often encoded with labels

`{rio}` (and `{haven}`) allow you to transform the data into the character/factor version

`{rio}` stores metadata from rich file formats (SPSS, Stata, etc.) in variable-level attributes in a consistent form regardless of file type or underlying import function 
* `characterize()` converts a single variable or all variables in the data that have *label* attributes into character vectors
* `factorize()` does the same but returns factor variables

---

```{r}
eclsk %>%
  select(child_id, k_type:sex) %>%
  head()
```

---

```{r}
eclsk %>%
  characterize() %>% #<<
  select(child_id, k_type:sex) %>%
  head()
```

---

# [`{readr}`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)

* Great package; most of the time "it just works" regardless of the source file type
* Loads with `{tidyverse}`
* Default loads data as a `tibble`
--
<br>
<br>
* [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html):   comma separated (CSV) files
* [`read_tsv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html):   tab separated files
* [`read_delim()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html): general delimited files
* [`read_fwf()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_fwf.html):   fixed width files
* [`read_table()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_table.html): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space
* [`read_log()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_log.html):   web log files

---

# [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html)

.darkorange[`read_csv`]`(`.darkblue[`file`]`, ...)`

.darkblue[`file`]       = a **path** to a file, a connection, or literal data (either a single string or a raw vector)

---

# 3b. Read in data

Try it!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# {haven} package
eclsk <- haven::read_sav(here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav"))

# read_table() for space separated data
fatality <- read_table(here("data", "Fatality.txt")) 

#read_csv(), the one I most often use
exam1 <- read_csv(here("data", "Project_Reads_Scores.csv"))

# read directly from the web, in this case a .csv
web <- read_csv("https://github.com/datalorax/ncme_18/raw/master/data/pubschls.csv")

```

---

# [`write_*()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)

Save data just as easily with `write_*()`

* For example:

.darkorange[`write_csv`]`(`.gray[`x`]`,` .darkblue[`file`]`, ...)`

.gray[`x`]      = data frame (tibble) to be written into a file

.darkblue[`file`] = character string naming a file to write to

--

* Basically

`write_*(what, "where")`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(exam1, here("data", "exam1.csv"))
```

# Scripts

---

# .R

.R is `R` script (code) file

*File* > *New File* > *R Script*

* Everything is code
* Text - comments! - need to begin with "`#`"
  + Comments are a **great** habit; use them!

Run code
* Ctrl/Command + Enter
* Highlight specific code, Ctrl/Command + Enter
* Put mouse on line, Ctrl/Command + Enter, and it will execute the all connected (piped) code

# .Rmd

.Rmd is a document format file that combines code **AND** prose
* *File* > *New File* > *R Markdown...*

--

Code goes into **"code chunks"**

````
```{r}`r ''`
# comment

data %>% 
  select(ide, read, math)
```
````

--

Prose goes outside the code chunks

--

**.darkorange[demo]**

---

# .R & .Rmd

* Both are great
* Serve different purposes

--

Organization tip
* .Rmd with headers
* .R with `# Header ----`

# Packages

--

**First** the package must be *installed* on your machine

`install.packages(‚Äúpackage_name‚Äù)`

--

* you will only need to do this the first time you want to use the package
* **never** keep this code line (you can run it in the console, or delete it from your script)
* notices the quotes

--

Any time you want to use a package it should be *loaded*

`library(package_name)`

--

* you will do this each time you use the package in your scripts
* notices no quotes

# Let's put it all together

---

# New script

Let's work Within the "my_first_project" .RProj 

1. Open a new R Markdown file 
  
  **.darkorange[demo]**
  
2.Clean it up
  + Modify the YAML
  + Remove all code chunks **except** the first one
  + Save the file as "practice.Rmd"

# Reading in data

1. What packages will we want to read in data?
* `library(here)`
* `library(rio)`
* `library(tidyverse)`
* `library(janitor)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(janitor)
```

2. Read in the data
* Let's name the data "reads" (because it is reading data)
* Three options

```{r}
# rio::import()
penguins <- import(here("data", "Penguins.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")

penguins <- import(here("data", "Penguins.csv"))

# readr::read_csv()
penguins <- read_csv(here("data", "Penguins.csv")) 
```

---

# What do our data look like?

```{r}
penguins
```

--

Or use `View()` to take a look at the full data in RStudio

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(penguins)
```


---

# clean_names()

```{r, message=FALSE}
# re-assign the "reads" object by reading the data in again
penguins <- read_csv(here("data", "Penguins.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

# or just work with the existing "penguins" object
penguins <- penguins %>% 
  clean_names()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/janitor_clean_names.png" width="50%" height="50%" class="center">

---

# Looking at the data `str`ucture

`dim`ensions (rows $\times$ columns)

```{r}
dim(penguins)
```

`str`ucture 
```{r}
str(penguins)
```

---

# `head()`

#### View the six first elements

--

In a data frame

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

--

Or in a vector
```{r}
head(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```


---

# Another cool package `{skimr}`

```{r, results='asis'}
library(skimr)

skim(penguins)
```

---

# How do we access variables?

* Generally, in this course, with `{tidyverse}` tools
* Sometimes with `$` or with `[]`
  + `data_name$variable_name`
  + `data_name["variable_name"]`

---

# Selecting varaibles

Select the `species` variable with `$`

--

```{r}
penguins$species
```

---

## Look at the `str`ucture of a variable

```{r}
str(penguins$species)
```

--

## Or and object

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

---

## Because `penguins` is a `tibble`

```{r}
penguins
```

---

# When to use `$`?

* Often when you need to use `{base} R` 
* Execute a function casually

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
table(penguins$species)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```
]

---

# Your turn

Run `table()` on the `island` variable

Produce a `hist`ogram of the `bill_length_mm ` variable

---

# The pipe operator (`%>%`)

* The `%>%` operator (Super + Shift + M) inserts the input from the left as the first argument in the next function
* To start, you can read it as, ‚Äúthen‚Äù
* It is crucial for work in the `{tidyverse}`
* We will talk about this a lot in this class

--

.pull-left[
 
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species)
```
]
--

.pull-right[
Or with `{janitor}`

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species)
```
]

---

# Why use `%>%`

Chaining arguments is **efficient** and **easy to read**

--

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie",
         bill_length_mm > 40) %>% 
  select(island, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>% 
  arrange(bill_length_mm) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

--

Equivalent to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
slice(arrange(select(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie", bill_length_mm > 40), island, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g), bill_length_mm), 1:5)
```

---

# The %>% cont.

The `%>%` works so well in the `{tidyverse}` because the first argument in (nearly) all functions is the data (tibble)

So you don't need to name the data each time

--

So this:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(sex)
```

--

Is equivalent to this:

```{r}
count(penguins, sex)
```
