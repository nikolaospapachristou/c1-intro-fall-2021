# Factors, Tables, Pull Requests 
## Week 9

---

# Agenda

*

**Overall Purpose**

* 

---
# First: Revisiting git

Talk with neighbor. What do these terms mean?
Talk about them in the order you would encounter them in your workflow 

* clone
* pull
* stage
* commit
* push
* repo
* remote

# Factors
## Just the basics

---
# When do we really want factors?

Generally two reasons to declare a factor

1. Only finite number of categories
  + Treatment/control
  + Income categories
  + Performance levels
  + etc.
2. Use in modeling

---
# Creating factos

Imagine you have a vector of months


```r
months_4 &lt;- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
```

--

We could store this as a string, but there are issues with this
* There are only 12 possible months
  + factors will help us weed out values that don't conform to our predefined levels, which helps safeguard against typos, etc.
* You can't sort this vector in a meaningful way
  + default is alphabetic sorting

--


```r
sort(months_4)
```

```
## [1] "Apr" "Dec" "Jan" "Mar"
```

---
# Define it as a factor


```r
months_4 &lt;- factor(months_4, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))
months_4
```

```
## [1] Dec Apr Jan Mar
## Levels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
```

--

Now we can sort


```r
sort(months_4)
```

```
## [1] Jan Mar Apr Dec
## Levels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
```

---
# Accessing and modifying levels

Uset the `levels()` function

--


```r
levels(months_4)
```

```
##  [1] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" "May" "Jun" "Jul" "Aug" "Sep" "Oct" "Nov" "Dec"
```

---
# Provides an error check of sorts


```r
months_4[5] &lt;- "Jam"
```

```
## Warning in `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, 5, value = "Jam"): invalid factor level, NA
## generated
```

--


```r
months_4
```

```
## [1] Dec  Apr  Jan  Mar  &lt;NA&gt;
## Levels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
```

---
# What if we don’t specify levels?

If you define a factor without specifying the levels, it will assign them alphabetically


```r
mnths &lt;- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar"))
```

--


```r
mnths
```

```
## [1] Dec Apr Jan Mar
## Levels: Apr Dec Jan Mar
```

---

# [`{forcats}`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)

* When working with factors, we can use the `{forcats}` package
  + `for cat`egorical variables
  + anagram of factors
--

* Part of the `{tidyverse}` so should be good to go
--

* All functions start with `fct_`
  + use the autofill in RStudio

---
# Change level order – `fct_inorder()`

#### In order they are entered

```r
(mnths &lt;- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")))
```

```
## [1] Dec Apr Jan Mar
## Levels: Apr Dec Jan Mar
```

--


```r
mnths %&gt;% 
  factor(., levels = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec")) %&gt;% 
  sort(.)
```

```
## [1] Jan Mar Apr Dec
## Levels: Jan Mar Apr Dec
```

---
# Change level order – `fct_inorder()`

#### In order they are entered

```r
(mnths &lt;- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")))
```

```
## [1] Dec Apr Jan Mar
## Levels: Apr Dec Jan Mar
```

--


```r
mnths %&gt;% 
  factor(., levels = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec")) %&gt;% 
* fct_inorder() %&gt;%
  sort(.)
```

```
## [1] Dec Apr Jan Mar
## Levels: Dec Apr Jan Mar
```

---
# Change level order – `fct_infreq()`

#### In order of frequency


```r
c("b", "b", "c", "a", "a", "a") %&gt;% 
*   fct_infreq()
```

```
## [1] b b c a a a
## Levels: a b c
```

--

This can be particularly useful for plotting

---
# Investigate factors

* `{tidyverse}` gives you convenient way to evaluate factors
  + `count()`
  + `geom_bar()` or `geom_col())` with `{ggplot2}`

* But don't forget about the base function `unique()`
  + e.g., `unique(df$factor_variable)`

# Collapsing levels – `fct_lump()`

#### `fct_lump()` – "lump" a bunch of categories together

* Default behavior creates an “Other" group that includes all but the largest group (i.e., lumps the factor into two groups)
* Can also take optional `n argument, where `n` represents the number of groups to collapse into


```r
gss_cat %&gt;% 
*   mutate(rel = fct_lump(relig)) %&gt;%
    count(rel)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   rel            n
##   &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Protestant 10846
## 2 Other      10637
```

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_lump()`

Collapse to 10 religious groups: top 9 groups plus "Other"

    count(rel)
```

# Review

`fct_inorder()`

--
* Levels ordered as entered

--

`fct_infreq()`

--
Change level order in order of frequency (largest first)

--

`fct_relevel()`

--
Change level order by hand

--

`fct_reorder()`

--
Change level order according to another variable

--

`fct_recode()`

--
Recode (collapse) levels into new named levels

--
`fct_collapse()`

--
Recode many levels into fewer levels

--

`fct_lump()`

--
Recode levels into top `n – 11 levels, plus "Other"

Default is `n = 2` levels (most frequent level plus "Other")

# Tables

**Many options**

* `knitr::kable()` for basic tables of any sort
  + try `booktabs = TRUE` argument for APA-like table format
  + Use `{kableExtra}` for extensions (example for [html](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html) and [pdf](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf))
* [`{gt}`](https://github.com/rstudio/gt)
  + tidy- and APA-friendly (with effort)
* [`{DT}`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
  + great for displaying a lot of data in a manageable way
  + multiple pages, search and sort features, etc.
* [`{reactable}`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)
  + great for displaying a lot of data in a manageable way
  + multiple pages, search and sort features, etc.
* [`{gtsummary}`](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/)
  + **amazing** for summary tables

# Table chunk options

For many tables, you may have to specify `results = "asis"` or you can end up with wacky display

````
```{r, chunk_name, results = "asis"}

```

# Peer Review of Data Prep Script

#### Expectations

Feedback:
1. Note &lt;u&gt;at least three&lt;/u&gt; areas of strength
2. Note &lt;u&gt;at least one&lt;/u&gt; thing you learned from reviewing their script
3. Note &lt;u&gt;at least one and no more than three&lt;/u&gt; areas for improvement
