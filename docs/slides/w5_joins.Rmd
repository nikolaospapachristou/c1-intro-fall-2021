# Mutating Joins
## Week 5

.footnote[

]

---

# Agenda

* Quick Share
* `bind_rows()`
* `*_join()`

**Overall Purpose**

* Understand and be able to identify keys
* Understand different types of mutating joins
  + `left_join`, `right_join`
  + one-to-one, one-to-many
* Understand some ways joins fail

---

# A bit about joins

* Also data "merge"

* Today we'll talk about  **mutating** joins

* Mutating joins add columns to a dataset

* Mutating joins are the most common, but **filtering** joins can be very powerful

--

### What if I want to add rows?

* Not technically a join (no key involved)

---
# Binding rows

```{r g34-datsets}
g3 <- tibble(sid = 1:3, 
             grade = rep(3, 3), 
             score = as.integer(rnorm(3, 200,10)))
g4 <- tibble(sid = 9:11, 
             grade = rep(4, 3), 
             score = as.integer(rnorm(3, 200,10)))
```

.pull-left[
```{r g3-print}
g3
```
]


.pull-left[
```{r g4-print}
g4
```
]

---
# `bind_rows()`

* In examples like the previous data sets, we just want to combine the data by **stacking the rows**

* Data have same (or approximately same) columns

* We can do so with `bind_rows()`

```{r bind_rows1}
bind_rows(g3, g4)
```

---
# `dplyr::bind_rows()`

* an efficient way to bind many data frames into one, by stacking rows
  + can bind multiple datasets
```{r, eval=FALSE}
one <- mtcars[1:4, ]
two <- mtcars[6:10, ]
three <- mtcars[12:14, ]
bind_rows(one, two, three)
```
  
* like joining (merging) data frames that have the same columns
* columns don't need to match when row-binding
---
# Optional `.id` argument

* What if we knew the grade, but didn't have a variable in each dataset already?

* Use `.id` to add an index for each dataset

```{r bind_rows2}
bind_rows(select(g3, -grade), select(g4, -grade), .id = "dataset")
```

---
# Recode .id column

```{r bind_rows_id_mutate}
bind_rows(select(g3, -grade), select(g4, -grade), .id = "dataset") %>%
  mutate(grade = ifelse(dataset == 1, 3, 4))
```

---
# Even better 

```{r bind_rows3}
bind_rows(select(g3, -grade), select(g4, -grade), .id = "grade") %>% 
  mutate(grade = ifelse(grade == 1, 3, 4))
```

---
### What if columns don't match exactly?

Pads with `NA`

```{r bind_rows4}
bind_rows(g3, g4[ ,-2], .id = "dataset")
```

---
# You can also `bind_cols()`

```{r}
read <- tibble(sid = 1:3, 
             read = as.integer(rnorm(3, 200,10)))
math <- tibble(math = as.integer(rnorm(3, 200,10)))
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
read
```
]

.pull-left[
```{r}
math
```
]

---
# `bind_cols()`

```{r}
bind_cols(read, math)
```

# Joins

(not to be confused with row binding)

---
# Keys
* Uniquely identify rows in a dataset

--

* Variable(s) in common between two datasets to be joined


--

  + A key can be more than one variable


--
### Types of keys

* Small distinction that you probably won't have to worry about much, but is
worth mentioning:
  + **Primary keys**: uniquely identify observations in *their* dataset
  + **Foreign keys**: uniquely identify observations in *other* datasets


---
# What's the primary key here? 

First, let's break down the code:

```{r load_ecls-k}
library(rio)
library(here)
ecls <- import(here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav"), 
               setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
    characterize()
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ecls
```

---
# Let's verify the key

```{r double_check_ecls}
ecls %>% 
  count(child_id)
```

---
# Let's verify the key

```{r}
ecls %>% 
  count(child_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  slice(1:3)
```

**.yellow[OR]**

```{r }
ecls %>% 
  count(child_id) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

---
## What about the key here?

```{r primary_key_income_ineq}
income_ineq <- read_csv(here("data", "incomeInequality_tidy.csv"))
head(income_ineq, n = 15)
```

---

```{r double_check_income_ineq}
income_ineq %>% 
    count(Year, percentile) %>% #<<
    filter(n > 1)
```

---
# Sometimes there is no key
These tables have an *implicit* id - the row numbers. For example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r flights}
head(flights)
```

---

```{r no_key}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight, tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) #<<
```

---
# Create a key

If there is no key, it's often helpful to add one

These are called *surrogate* keys

```{r add_key}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  rowid_to_column()

flights2 %>% 
  select(1:3, ncol(flights))
```

# Mutating joins

---
# Mutating `*_joins()`

* In `{tidyverse}`, we use `mutate()` to create new variables within a dataset

--

* A mutating join works similarly, in that we're adding new variables to the existing dataset through a join

--

* **Join**: Two tables of data joined by a common key

---
# Four types of joins

<br>

* `left_join`: keep all the data in the **left** dataset, drop any non-matching cases from the right dataset

* `right_join`: keep all the data in the **right** dataset, drop any non-matching cases from the left dataset

<br>

* `inner_join`: keep **only** data that matches in <b>both</b> datasets

* `full_join`: keep **all** the data in <b>both</b> datasets (also sometimes referred to as an *outer* join)

---

# Using joins to recode

Say you have a dataset like this

```{r eth-code-tbl}
set.seed(1)
disab_codes <- c("00", "10", "20", "40", "43", "50", "60", 
                 "70", "74", "80", "82", "90", "96", "98")
dis_tbl <- tibble(
  sid = 1:200,
  dis_code = sample(disab_codes, 200, replace = TRUE),
  score = as.integer(rnorm(200, 200, 10))
  )
head(dis_tbl)
```

---
### Codes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~Code,                        ~Disability,
     0L,                 "'Not Applicable'",
    10L,        "'Intellectual Disability'",
    20L,             "'Hearing Impairment'",
    40L,              "'Visual Impairment'",
    43L,                 "'Deaf-Blindness'",
    50L,         "'Communication Disorder'",
    60L,          "'Emotional Disturbance'",
    70L,          "'Orthopedic Impairment'",
    74L,         "'Traumatic Brain Injury'",
    80L,       "'Other Health Impairments'",
    82L,       "'Autism Spectrum Disorder'",
    90L,   "'Specific Learning Disability'",
    96L,      "'Developmental Delay 0-2yr'",
    98L,      "'Developmental Delay 3-4yr'"
  ) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 20)

```

# Recode method

Using `case_when()`

```{r dis-recode-case_when, eval = FALSE}
dis_tbl %>% 
  mutate(disability = case_when(
    dis_code == "10" ~ "Intellectual Disability",
    dis_code == "20" ~ 'Hearing Impairment',
    ...,
    TRUE ~ "Not Applicable"
    )
  )
```

---
# Join method

```{r cod-tbl}
dis_code_tbl <- tibble(
  dis_code = c(
    "00", "10", "20", "40", "43", "50", "60",
    "70", "74", "80", "82", "90", "96", "98"
    ),
  disability = c(
    'Not Applicable', 'Intellectual Disability',
    'Hearing Impairment', 'Visual Impairment',
    'Deaf-Blindness', 'Communication Disorder',
    'Emotional Disturbance', 'Orthopedic Impairment',
    'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Other Health Impairments', 
    'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Specific Learning Disability', 
    'Developmental Delay 0-2yr', 'Developmental Delay 3-4yr'
    )
  )
```

---
```{r print-dis_code_tbl}
dis_code_tbl
```

## What if the key is not unique?

* Not an issue, as long as they are unique in .bolder[one] of the tables
  + In this case, it's called a one-to-many join

# Example

.pull-left[
### Student-level data
```{r stu_lev}
(stu <- tibble(
  sid = 1:9,
  scid = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  score = c(10, 12, 15, 8,  9, 11, 12, 15, 17)))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
### School-level data
```{r }
(schl <- tibble(
  scid = 1:3,
  stu_tch_ratio = c(22.05, 31.14, 24.87),
  per_pupil_spending = c(15741.08, 11732.24, 13027.88)
  )
)
```
]

---
# One to many
```{r one_to_many_merge}
left_join(stu, schl)
```

---
## What if key is not unique to either table?
Generally this is an error

Result is probably not going to be what you want

<div align = "center">
<img src = images/cartesian_product.png width = 1000>
</div>

---
# Example

```{r demos}
seasonal_means <- tibble(
  scid = rep(1:3, each = 3),
  season = rep(c("fall", "winter", "spring"), 3),
  mean = rnorm(3*3)
)
seasonal_means
```

---
```{r dup_merge}
left_join(stu, seasonal_means) 
```

---
# How do we fix this?

--
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media4.giphy.com/media/TgxSogEZU4exOupzRN/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4761vyz0plz2gqtplwgdbnzniwh2s2ffcxlz2gnh23&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g")
```


In some cases, the solution is obvious, in others it is not
<br>
<br>

But **you must have at least one unique key** to join the datasets

---
# In this case
Move the dataset to wide before joining

--
#### Move to wide
```{r }
seasonal_means_wide <- seasonal_means %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "season",
              values_from = "mean")
seasonal_means_wide
```

.footnote[
We will cover this in Week 8
]

---
# Join

One to many join
```{r }
left_join(stu, seasonal_means_wide)
```

---
# Another example

* Often you want to add summary info to your dataset


* You can do this easily with by piping arguments

--
#### ECLS-K reminder

```{r }
ecls
```

---
# Compute group means

```{r }
ecls %>% 
  group_by(school_id) %>% 
  summarize(sch_pre_math = mean(T1MSCALE)) 
```

---
# Join right within pipeline

```{r print_ecls}
ecls %>% 
  group_by(school_id) %>% 
  summarize(sch_pre_math = mean(T1MSCALE)) %>% 
  left_join(ecls) %>% #<<
  select(school_id:k_type) # Just for space
```

---
# Default join behavior 

By default, the `_join` functions will use all columns with common names as keys

--

```{r flights2, highlight.output = c(2)}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2[1:2, ]
```

--

```{r weather, highlight.output = c(2)}
weather[1:2, ]
```

---

```{r join_flights_weather, message = TRUE}
left_join(flights2, weather)
```

---
# Use only certain keys?

If we were joining *flights2* and *planes*, we would not want to use the `year` variable in the join, because **it means different things in each dataset**

```{r planes}
head(planes)
```

---
# Specify `*_join()` keys

Specify the variables with `by`

```{r join_flights2_planes}
left_join(flights2, planes, by = "tailnum")
```

---
# Specify `*_join()` keys

I like to *always* specify the `by` vars
<br>

Makes intent explicit
<br>

Helps me review my own code

---
# Mismatched key names

What if you had data to merge like this?

```{r stu_table}
names(schl)[1] <- "school_id"
schl
stu
```

---
## Join with mismatched key names

```{r join_name_mismatch}
left_join(stu, schl, by = c("scid" = "school_id"))
```
